            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Subhas Chandra Bose, famously known as Netaji, was a revered Indian freedom fighter celebrated for his fierce patriotism and revolutionary approach to India’s independence. Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, Bose was a brilliant student who studied at Presidency College and later at Cambridge University. He qualified for the Indian Civil Services but resigned, unwilling to serve the British. Influenced by Swami Vivekananda, he joined the Indian National Congress, where he quickly rose as a prominent leader. However, his strong stance on immediate independence clashed with Gandhi’s non-violent approach, leading him to separate from Congress and seek alternative means to liberate India.
                Netaji’s charisma and courage make him an enduring symbol of strength, resilience, and dedication. His famous rallying cries, such as "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom!" and "Jai Hind!", have become part of India’s patriotic legacy, reminding each generation of the courage needed to achieve freedom. Even decades after his passing, Netaji’s life and ideals continue to resonate, instilling a deep respect and reverence for a leader who dared to dream of a free India and was willing to risk everything to make it a reality.
